Hello, welcome to Local Grid World! Your job is simple: help our agent complete levels. How do you do this? Easy! I'll ask you to edit some files which represent training levels. Our agent will train on those levels and, if you did your job well, our agent will be able to beat these much tricker levels. Make sure to look for patterns in the target level as well! Anyways, let's get this going. I hope you enjoy. Down the line, we may let you control the reward! But for now, buckle up and get ready. 

NOTE: Please use an editor like Visual Studio Code so it is easy to edit the files as you go. This is just a prototype, so don't judge me... please, don't judge me.
